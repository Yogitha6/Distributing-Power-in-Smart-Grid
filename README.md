## Requirements:
Java 8 - JDK 1.8

## Compilation:
Compile the program everytime you make some change to the code
Go to the Simulation folder and run the following command:

	`"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_66\bin\javac.exe" *.java`

or if Java 1.8 is already in your path then just the following command would work:

	`javac.exe *.java`

## Executing the program:
Open five terminals to represent 5 houses, navigate to the src folder and run the following command:

	`"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_66\bin\java.exe" -cp . simulation.HouseApp 1`

or if Java 1.8 is already in your path then just the following command would work:

	`java.exe -cp . simulation.HouseApp 1`

For each of the five houses, give different house ids ranging from 1 to 5.
